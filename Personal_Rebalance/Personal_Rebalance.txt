Possible Plans:
---
Troopers fire faster? Full Auto? [MAYBE]

Look into how AI Rebalance works (Ex. Extra Enemy Armor) [MAYBE]
	Speed/Aim of Pointman class
	
	Global aimspeed increase for player units

	Increased pistol effectiveness in general

	Accuracy/Speed/Followup Speed/Bullet Count increase for attack types

	Remove extra armor applied to all enemies

Look into how Rebalanced Equipments and Classes works (Ex. Pointman FOV) [MAYBE]

	Fix Mozambique minimum distance

	Shield handgun accuracy buff 

	Apply handgun skill to shield class (Precision, Double Tap, Mozambique)

	Pointman FOV increase, perception increase

	Shield can use lockpick, spy camera

Reskin Double Dave (Shotgun Thug)
	Red Shirt?
